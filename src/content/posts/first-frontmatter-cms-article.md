# My first FrontmatterCMS post

I just downloaded the **FrontmatterCMS** extension for VScode! It seems like a pretty great way to get this blog going. This is the first post on this blog that I've actually written myself, all the previous posts were part of the tutorial. By the way, the tutorial's great; if you want to get started with learning Astro, [click here!](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/)

## The steps I had to take

So, for this to work, I first had to make some changes to my blog. I needed to start using Astro's Content Collections so I went ahead and created a **content** folder, along with a **config.ts** file to specify what the content should look like, and a **posts** subfolder, where I moved all my .md files. In their place I created and filled in a **"slug"** file, a special type of file used by the content collection system for routing.

## Simple and easy to use

There's some good **Getting Started instructions** on Astro's documentation. You can either use the premade Astro Blog template, or [follow the tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) on the site.
