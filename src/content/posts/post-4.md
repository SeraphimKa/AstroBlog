This post should show up with my other blog posts, because `Astro.glob()` is returning a list of all my posts in order to create my list.

### Update

I'm no longer using `Astro.glob()` to get all my posts. I'm now using the `Content Collections` **Astro** feature! It's a bit more messy at first, but once you set it up, it's much better for organizing content groups in your website. Check out how to use it [here!](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections)

Also, check out my post about FrontmatterCMS, a great tool to use with your content collections, [->](/posts/frontmattercms-post)
